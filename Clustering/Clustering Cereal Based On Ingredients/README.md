# Clustering Cereal Based On Ingredients

In this tutorial, we will predict the which cereals would belong in the same category as other cereals, based on their ingredients and nutrition information. To do this, we will be using the Mean Shift algorithm.

The source code for each part can be found in the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/MLMadeSimple/Python-Machine-Learning-Tutorials/tree/main/Clustering/Clustering%20Cereal%20Based%20On%20Ingredients).

## Part 1 - The Data
The data set which will be used in this tutorial will come from the user [crawford](https://www.kaggle.com/crawford) over on www.kaggle.com and can be found at https://www.kaggle.com/crawford/80-cereals.
